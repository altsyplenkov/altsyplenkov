# Hello, my name is Alexander Tsyplenkov!

I'm currently studying at **Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Geography, Department of Cartography and Geoinformatics**. Back at school I had understood I was interested in combining my interests in geography and programming. For this reason, I decided to have a try at learning geoinformatics at Lomonosov MSU where I've been studying for 3 years by now. I'm currently working on my undergraduate thesis devoted to *DEMs smoothing filtering for the morphometric values calculation*

* üåç  I'm based in Moscow, Russia
* ‚úâÔ∏è  You can contact me at [altsyplenkov@gmail.com](mailto:altsyplenkov@gmail.com)
* üß†  I'm currently studying spatial analysis and digital elevation modelling
